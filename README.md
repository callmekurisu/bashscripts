Bash shell scripting fun

I just started using Linux a few months ago and I really love it.
This is my first bash shell script

Its actually kind of dangerous because it will delete all executable files
in the current directory. 

There are safeguards in place but read and use with caution.

Give some tips too, I'm still learning. (^_^)
